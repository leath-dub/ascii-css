# Ascii CSS
Ascii css is a simple css framework for text based websites.

## Motivation
[kisslinux.org](https://kisslinux.org/) was a very big motivator, I love the
look of the website, however it, afaik is done manually and you can't just
import a stylesheet/js to get the look and feel.

## Usage
For now you can clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/leath-dub/ascii-css
```
and just link to the css and javascript files
```html
<link href="ascii-css/css/ascii.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="ascii-css/js/ascii.js"></script>
```
